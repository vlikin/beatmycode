Questions:

- How do the Proxy, Decorator, Adapter, and Bridge Patterns differ?

Proxy - ?

Decorator - This is used when you want to add functionality to an object, but not by extending that object's type. This allows you to do so at runtime.

Adapter is used when you have an abstract interface, and you want to map that interface to another object which has similar functional role, but a different interface.

Bridge - ?

Facade is a higher-level (read: simpler) interface to a subsystem of one or more classes. Think of Facade as a sort of container for other objects, as opposed to simply a wrapper.
